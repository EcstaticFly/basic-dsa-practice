# 📂 College DSA & Mini Projects Archive

Hey there! 👋  
This repo is a snapshot of a folder I created when I had just started college.  
Back then, I was exploring the world of programming, practicing **basic DSA**, writing **lab class codes**, and even working on a small **Python mini-project** (pretty sure it was a movie recommendation system 🎬).

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

- 🧮 Basic DSA practice (from when recursion was a nightmare)
- 💻 College lab programs ( C, C++, Python, maybe even some HTML)
- 🎓 A mini-project or two (movie recommendation system, vaguely remember that)
- 📂 Some random files I probably forgot to delete 🙃

## ❓Why is this on GitHub?

I don’t use this folder much nowadays, but I didn’t want to just delete it.  
It reminds me of:

> **Where I started. Where I am now. And where I still need to go.**

So instead of letting it rot in a dusty corner of my drive, I’m archiving it here.

## ✌️Final Words

If you’re reading this — thanks, man.  
You’re cool. 😎
